Pytorch Temporal Fusion Transformers

WIP: check custom/run.py for now. It is working but messy.

The main model is taken from pytorch-forecasting. The problem with libraries like that it can be really hard to debug what is going on if you want to understand. I also couldn't replicate the original results. This repo is great if you want more control over your data processing and understand the implementation.
